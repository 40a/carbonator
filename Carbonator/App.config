    defaultCulture setting specifies which culture set will be used to find Performance Counters
      on non-English Windows installations, performance counter names will be in the localized language
      this setting may be necessary to use English names (e.g. Processor vs. Процессор (ru-RU))

    <!--
      logType: specifies which type of logging engine to use
          - eventlog: log to Windows Event log using Information/Warning/Error levels (this is the default)
          - log4net:  log to file using log4net (see below for configuration)
          - none:     disable logging

      logLevel has been deprecated, but setting preserved for configuration compatibility reasons

      maxMetricBufferSize:  tune maximum number of metrics that will be stored in Carbonator's memory before they are sent on
                            a different thread. If this buffer is full, no new metrics will be stored until it is cleared again
                            (this can happen if connection to the server is lost; metrics will keep piling up)
                            
                            Default is 21600 metrics (say 1 metric per second for 6 hours)
                            
                            Any value less than or equal to 0 will disable this limit (CAUTION: may lead to excessive memory usage
                            if connection to the graphite server is unreliable and you're collecting lots of metrics)     
      
      collectionInterval:   specifies how often Performance Counter values are collected in milliseconds
                            decreasing this value will increase metric accuracy at the cost of higher CPU usage by Carbonator
      
      reportingInterval:    specifies how often collected metrics in internal buffer are sent to the destination server, in milliseconds

      performance counters that will be collected 
      special variables:
      
        %HOST%  -  substitutes current computer name (Environment.MachineName)
        %host%  -  substitutes current computer name forced in lowercase
      
      New in v1.5:
      
        Strings are escaped for incompatible characters before carbon path is formed, characters are replaced with underscores (_)
      
        %COUNTER_CATEGORY%  - current counter category name
        %COUNTER_NAME%      - current counter name
        %COUNTER_INSTANCE%  - current counter instance (just underscore for counters without an instance)
      
        % ... %   - Any system environment variable, for example %PATH%, %OS%, for convenience
        
      Counter Watcher elements:
        path:       carbon/graphite metric path (see above)
        
        category:   performance counter category to load
        
        counter:    performance counter name
        
        instance:   (optional) performance counter instance name, or empty string
                    This attribute supports a regular expression, carbonator will load all instances matching
                    the regular expression when service starts
